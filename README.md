C++11 EventBus
========

An synchronous event system for C++11

Intro
-----

Like many other event frameworks, this project allows you to reduce dependencies and decouple your C++11 code by leveraging synchronous events and event handlers. 

Unlike mananged languages C# and Java, C++ is statically typed and doesn't support reflection which makes event frameworks slightly more difficult.
