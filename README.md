C++11 EventBus
========

An synchronous event system for C++11

Overview
-----

Like many other event frameworks, this project allows you to reduce dependencies and decouple your C++11 code by leveraging synchronous events and event handlers.

Unlike mananged languages C# and Java, C++ is statically typed and doesn't support reflection making event systems slightly more difficult. This project attempts to create a simple event framework that can be applied to any C++11 project that includes boost.
